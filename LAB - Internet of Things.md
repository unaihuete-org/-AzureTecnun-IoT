# Internet of Things hands-on lab step-by-step

If you have not yet completed the steps to set up your environment in [Before the hands-on lab setup guide](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md), you will need to do that before proceeding.

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end IoT solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analyzed in Azure. You will design a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all the data in long-term storage for the cold path.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build an IoT solution implementing device registration with the IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service and visualizing hot data with Power BI.

## Overview

Fabrikam provides services and smart meters for enterprise energy (electrical power) management. Their **You-Left-The-Light-On** service enables the enterprise to understand their energy consumption.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Diagram of the preferred solution described in the next paragraph.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png 'Preferred high-level architecture')

Smart Meters are installed in buildings. They will register with a Device Provisioning Service using an attestation method through an enrollment group. Once registered and connected, messages are ingested from the Smart Meters via the IoT Hub that the Device Provisioning Service assigned to the device. A Stream Analytics job pulls telemetry messages from IoT Hub and sends the messages to two different destinations. There are two Stream Analytics jobs, one that retrieves all messages and sends them to Blob Storage (the cold path), and another that selects out only the important events needed for reporting in real time (the hot path). Data entering the hot path will be reported on using Power BI visualizations and reports. For the cold path, Azure Databricks can be used to apply the batch computation needed for the reports at scale.

> **Note**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio)
- A running Azure Databricks cluster (see [Before the hands-on lab](./Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Internet%20of%20Things.md))

## Exercise 1: IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service deployment

Duration: 30 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed upon to use Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to manage automatic device registration. The DPS would then assign an IoT Hub to the device that ingests telemetry from the Smart Meter Simulator. In this exercise, you will deploy an IoT Hub and DPS to enable device registration and connectivity.
### Task 0: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

2. In the Add Enrollment Group form, populate it as follows, then select the **Save** button.

    - **Group name**: Enter `smartmeter-device-group`.
    - **Attestation Type**: Select `Symmetric Key`.
    - **Auto-generate keys**: Checked.
    - **IoT Edge device**: Select `False`.
    - **Select how you want to assign devices to hubs**: Select `Evenly weighted distribution`.
    - **Select the IoT hubs this group can be assigned to**: Select `smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}.azure-devices.net`.
    - **Select how you want the device data to be handled on re-provisioning**: Select `Re-provision and migrate data`.
    - **Initial Device Twin State**: Retain the default value.
    - **Enable entry**: Select `Enable`.
  
   ![The Add Enrollment Group form is shown populated with the preceding values.](media/dps_addenrollmentgroup_form.png "Add Enrollment Group form")

3. Select the newly created enrollment group from the **Enrollment Groups** list.

4. On the Enrollment Group Details screen, copy the **Primary Key** value and record it for a future task.

    ![The Enrollment Group Details screen is shown with the copy button highlighted next to the Primary Key field.](media/dps_enrollmentgroup_primarykey.png "Enrollment Group Details")

## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1. On your **Lab VM**, open the folder **/lab-files/starter-project/SmartMeterSimulator** in **Visual Studio Code**. 
1. From **Visual Studio Code **, open the file `DeviceManager.cs`.

3. You will see a list of **TODO** tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Complete the line of code below each **TODO** using the code below as a reference. If your task list is blank, **complete/copy TODO steps 1-5** as indicated in the code in the next step.

    >**Note**: Sometimes the Task List will not populate, this will not impact completing this lab.

3. In the **Create Notebook** dialog, enter `smartmeters` as the **Name** and select **Python** as the **Language**, then select **Create**.

   ![In the Create Notebook dialog, smartmeters is entered as the Name, and Python is selected in the Language drop down.](media/azure-databricks-create-notebook-dialog.png 'Create Notebook dialog')

    > **Note**: If your cluster is stopped, you can select the down arrow next to your attached cluster name, and select Start Cluster from the menu, then select Confirm when prompted.

4. In the **first cell** of your **Databricks notebook** (referred to as a paragraph in notebook jargon), enter the following **Python code** that creates widgets in the notebook for entering your **Azure storage account name** and **key**.

   ```python
   # Create widgets for storage account name and key
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountName", "", "Account Name")
   dbutils.widgets.text("accountKey", "", "Account Key")
   ```

    > **Note**:  Make sure to be aware of any indents\tabs. Python  treats indents\tabs with specific syntactical meaning.

5. Now, select the **Run** button on the right side of the cell and select **Run cell**.

   ![A cell in a Databricks Notebook is displayed, and the Run menu is visible with Run Cell highlighted in the menu.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-run-cell.png 'Datebricks Notebook run cell')

6. When the cell finishes executing, you will see the **Account Key** and **Account Name** widgets appear at the top of the notebook, just below the toolbar.

   ![In the Databricks notebook, Account Key and Account Name widgets are highlighted.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

7. You will also notice a message at the bottom of the cell, indicating that the cell execution completed, and the amount of time it took.

   ![A message is displayed at the bottom of the cell indicating how long the command took to execute.](media/azure-databricks-cell-execution-time.png 'Cell execution time')

8. Enter your **Azure Storage account key** into the **Account Key widget text box**, and your **Azure storage account name** into the **Account Name widget text box**. These values can be obtained from the **Access keys** blade in your storage account.

    ![The Account Key and Account Name widgets are populated with values from the Azure storage account.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-widgets-populated.png 'Databricks Notebooks widgets')

9. At the bottom of the **first cell**, select the **+** button to insert a new cell below it.

    ![The Insert new cell button is highlighted at the bottom of the Databricks cell.](media/azure-databricks-insert-new-cell.png 'Insert new cell')

10. In the **new cell**, paste the following code that will assign the values you entered into the widgets you created above into variables that will be used throughout the notebook.

    ```python
    # Get values entered into widgets
    accountName = dbutils.widgets.get("accountName")
    accountKey = dbutils.widgets.get("accountKey")
    ```

11. Run the cell.

12. **Insert a new cell** into the notebook and paste the following code to mount your blob storage account into Databricks File System (DBFS), then **run** the cell. **It may take some minutes for the mount to complete.**

    ```python
    # Mount the blob storage account at /mnt/smartmeters. This assumes your container name is smartmeters, and you have a folder named smartmeters within that container, as specified in the exercises above.
    if not any(mount.mountPoint == '/mnt/smartmeters' for mount in dbutils.fs.mounts()): 
      dbutils.fs.mount(
      source = "wasbs://smartmeters@" + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net/smartmeters",
      mount_point = "/mnt/smartmeters",
      extra_configs = {"fs.azure.account.key." + accountName + ".blob.core.windows.net": accountKey})
    ```

    > **Note**: Mounting Azure Blob storage directly to DBFS allows you to access files as if they were on the local file system. Once your blob storage account is mounted, you can access them with Databricks Utilities, `dbutils.fs` commands.

13. **Insert a new cell** and paste the code below to see how **dbutils.fs.ls** can be used to list the files and folders directly below the **smartmeters** folder.

    ```python
    # Inspect the file structure
    display(dbutils.fs.ls("/mnt/smartmeters/"))
    ```

14. **Run** the cell.

15. You know from inspecting the files in the storage container that the files are contained within a folder structure resembling, **smartmeters/YYYY-DD-MM/HH**. You can use wildcards to obfuscate the date and hour folders, as well as the file names, and access all the files in all the folders. **Insert another cell** into the notebook, paste the following code, and **run** the cell to load the data from the files in blob storage into a **Databricks Dataframe**.

    ```python
    # Create a Dataframe containing data from all the files in blob storage, regardless of the folder they are located within.
    df = spark.read.options(header='true', inferSchema='true').csv("dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/*/*/*.csv",header=True)
    print(df.dtypes)
    ```

    > **Note**: In some rare cases, you may receive an error that the **dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/\*/\*/\*.csv** path is incorrect. If this happens, change the path in the cell to the following: **dbfs:/mnt/smartmeters/\*/\*/\*/\*/\*.csv**

16. The cell above also outputs the value of the **df.dtypes** property, which is a list of the data types of the columns added to the **Dataframe**, similar to the following:

    ![Output from the df.dtypes property is displayed representing each column and type in the dataframe schema.](media/azure-databricks-df-dtypes-output.png 'Output from Dataframe dtypes')

    >**Note**: Do not worry if any of the time columns in the output are represented as `string`s, rather than `timestamp`s. It is simple to perform this cast if you need to. 

17. **Insert another cell** and run the following code to view the first 10 records contained in the **Dataframe**.

    ```python
    df.show(10)
    ```

18. Now, you can save the **Dataframe** to a **global table** in **Databricks**. This will make the table accessible to all users and clusters in your Databricks workspace. **Insert a new cell** and **run** the following code.

    ```python
    df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("SmartMeters")
    ```

19. Now, you will use the `%sql` magic command to change the language of the next cell to **SQL** from the notebook's default language, Python, then execute a SQL command to aggregate the SmartMeter data by average temperature. Paste the following code into **a new cell** and **run** the cell:

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id
    ```

20. The output from the SQL command should resemble the following table:

    ![Output from executing a SQL statement a Databricks notebook cell using the %sql magic command.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-sql-magic-command.png 'SQL magic command')

21. Now, execute the same command in **a new cell**, this time using **Spark SQL** so you can save the summary data into a Dataframe. Copy and **execute** the following code into **a new cell**:

    ```python
    # Query the table to create a Dataframe containing the summary
    summary = spark.sql("SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(temp) AS averageTemp FROM SmartMeters GROUP BY id ORDER BY id")

    # Save the new pre-computed table
    summary.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("DeviceSummary")
    ```

22. Next, query from this summary table by **executing** the following query in **a new cell**:

    ```sql
    %sql
    SELECT * FROM DeviceSummary
    ```

23. **Below** the results table, notice the area to change the visualization for the tabular output. Expand the **Chart** menu and choose the **Bar** option.

    ![Buttons for displaying tabular results in different formats in Databricks](media/azure-databricks-notebook-visualizations.png 'Visualization options')

24. With the Bar chart visualization chosen, a **Plot Options..** button appears. Select **Plot Options..** and in the **Customize Plot** dialog, ensure the following are set:

    - **Keys**: **id**
    - **Values**: **averageTemp**
    - **Aggregation**: Select **AVG**.
    - Select **Grouped** as the chart type.
    - **Display type**: Select **Bar chart**.

      ![Plot customization options dialog in Azure databricks, with id in the Keys field, averageTemp in the Values field, Aggregation set to AVG, and the chart set to a grouped bar chart.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-customize-plot.png)

25. Select **Apply**.

26. Observe the results graphed as a column chart, where each column represents a device's average temperature.

    ![A bar chart is displayed, with devices on the X axis, and average temperatures on the Y axis.](media/azure-databricks-notebook-visualizations-bar-chart.png 'Bar chart')

## Exercise 5: Sending commands to the IoT devices

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to send commands to devices from the cloud in order to control their behavior. In this exercise, you will send commands that control the temperature settings of individual devices.

### Task 1: Add your IoT Hub connection string to the CloudToDevice console app

This console app is configured to connect to IoT Hub using the same connection string you use in the SmartMeterSimulator app. Messages are sent from the console app to IoT Hub, specifying a device by its ID, for example **Device1**. IoT Hub then transmits that message to the device when it is connected. This is called a **cloud-to-device message**. The console app is not directly connecting to the device and sending it the message. All messages flow through IoT Hub where the connections and device state are managed.

1. On your lab VM, open **Visual Studio Code** and the **lab-files/starter-project/CloudToDevice** folder.

2. In the **Explorer**,  open **Program.cs**. 

3. Replace **YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING** on line 13 with your IoT Hub connection string. You can get it in the Azure Portal, **IoT Hub > Shared Access Policies > iothubowner > Primary connection string** The line you need to update looks like this:

    ```csharp
    static string connectionString = "YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING";
    ```

    After updating, your **Program.cs** file should look similar to the following:

    ![The Program.cs file has been updated with the code change.](media/visual-studio-program-cs.png 'Program.cs')

4. Save the file.

### Task 2: Send cloud-to-device messages

In this task, you will leave the simulator running and separately launch the console app to start sending cloud-to-device messages.

> **Note**: Re-run the Smart Meter Simulator in case stopped. You will have one Visual Studio Code instance running the Smart Meter Simulator and another running the cloud-to-device app. 

1. If you hover over one of the windows, you will see a dialog display information about the associated device, including the Device ID (in this case, **Device0**), Device Key, Temperature, and Indicator. The legend on the bottom shows the indicator displayed for each temperature range. The Device ID is important when sending cloud-to-device messages, as this is how we will target a specific device when we remotely set the desired temperature. Keep the Device ID values in mind when sending the messages in the next task.

    ![A dialog containing device information is displayed after hovering over a window.](media/smart-meter-simulator-device-info.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

2. Within the **CloudtoDevice** Visual Studio Code window, click on **F5** > **.NET5+ and .NET Core**. It will create a **.vscode/launch.json** file. Open the file and modify to **"console": "externalTerminal"**. Then, click **F5**.

3. In the **console window**, enter a **device number** when prompted. Accepted values are 0-9, since there are 10 devices whose IDs begin with 0. You can hover over the windows in the **Smart Meter Simulator** to view the Device IDs. When you enter a number, such as `0`, then a message will be sent to **Device0**. Be certain to select the device number of a registered window!

    ![The value of 0 is entered when prompted for the device number in the console window.](media/console-device-number.png 'Console App')

4. Now enter a **temperature value** between 65 and 85 degrees (F) when prompted. If you set a value above 72 degrees, the window will turn red. If the value is set between 68 and 72 degrees, it will turn green. Values below 68 degrees will turn the window blue. Once you set a value, the device will remain at that value until you set a new value, rather than randomly changing.

    ![A value of 70 has been entered for the temperature. A new log entry in the Smart Meter Simulator appears in yellow showing the message value of 70 sent to Device0.](media/console-temperature.png 'Console App and Smart Meter Simulator')

    If you run the **Smart Meter Simulator** side-by-side with the **console app**, you can observe the message logged by the Smart Meter Simulator within seconds. This message appears with a yellow background and displays the temperature request value sent to the device. In our case, we sent a request of 70 degrees to Device0. The console app indicates that it is sending the temperature request to the indicated device.

5. Hover over the device to which you sent the message. You will see that its temperature is set to the value you requested through the console app.

    ![Device0 is hovered over and the dialog appears showing the temperature set to the requested temperature.](media/smart-meter-simulator-set-temp.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

6. In the console window, you can enter `Y` to send another message. Experiment with setting the temperature on other devices and observe the results.
